operators : Arithmetic operator , assignment operator.

    - bitwise operator used to do math (logical operation) on the  binary value .
    - to find the decimal number of a binary we can do : print(int('111',2));
    - compliment (Not)(~):- it will add one and multiple by negetive one .
    - And (&):
    - or(|);
    - xor(^);similar=0 and different=1;
    - left shift(<<);shifting the zeros to left.
    - right shift(>>):shifting the zeros to right.

     if variable.isdigit():
1. logical error(exception ): error occur at runtime.
2. error handling:  try and except;
3. loop: for loop and while loop;
