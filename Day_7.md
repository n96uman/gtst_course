1.==PSEUDO code==: simplified , structure way of writing down programming logic.
## History 
1. evaluation of I/o :early history of computing , programs were submitted on punch cards with all data. out put was line printer.
     - later development create interactive processing . and it was question and answer format.
2. generation of computers
    1. first generation: use vacuum tube => punch cards.
    2. second generation: transistor => programming started here with Assembly.
    3. Third generation: integrated circuits.=> basic , cobol , pascal , fortran , c , c++ , peri  and ada.
    4. Fourth generation : Microprocessors => python , SQL , matlab.
    5. Fifth generation : Artificial intelligence.
3. ==Types of programming language.==:
    1. low level: it is close to the machine and faster (it close to the machine).
    2. high level: it is close to human and they are slower.
    - how do high level language work 
        1. compilers: change to bytecode then he computer executed.
        2. interpreter: directly execute a code by reading the source code.
## python
1. ==IDE==(integrated development Enviroment):
    - software that helps you to write and run specific programming.
2. code editor: help you to write and kind of programming language.
