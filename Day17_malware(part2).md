## Malware prevention 
1. install anti-virus and anti-spyware software.
    a. Enable real-time scanning to detect threats early
    b. check for any whitelisted path/Directory
2. Keep antimalware updated
3. use secure authentication methods
    a. 2-factor authentication 
    b. implement email security and spam protection
4. keep software update
5. Use the least-privilege model
6. monitor for suspicious activity
7. Backup strategy:
    - maintain regular, offline backups of critical data.
    - Test backups periodically to ensure reliability.
8. Education your users.
## Malware Attack counterMeasures
- identify the Type of Malware:(you can use malpedia to identify the family)
- Assess Damage
- Immediately Disconnect internet
- Run a full system scan with the Antivirus you have.
- if you have any saved passwords on your browser, try to change password of all the accounts.
- Try to remove any background Running program.
- try to remove any software you installed recently from suspicious place.
- try to remove any document you copied to you system recently.
- check your email you get any suspicious Texts.
## malware Attack recovery 
Address Ransomware-specific scenarios
- DO not pay the ransom
- use Decryption tools
- contact authorities
## Malware Attack recovery
Data recovery steps
- steps 1: Restore from Backups
    - use the most recent unaffected backup to recover data.
    - ensure backups are verified and clean before restoring.
- Steps 2: use recovery Tools
    - employ professional recovery tools for partially corrupted or deleted files.
    - Example: recuva , Ea seUS data Recovery , or enterprise-grade solutions
- Steps 3 : work with vendors
    - engage backup and recovery solution vendors if specialized tools or expertise are needed.
 - steps 4: patch and secure:
    - update all systems and software to prevent a recurrence.
## malware history
1. morris worm: first computer worms
2. Iloveyou: 
3. stuxnet:
4. wannacry:
## python for malware development 
- you can convert your python file to executable(exe)by py2exe technics.
- most of the time malware can be write with C# and low level programming.
### malware #1 - File deleting malware
1. import os (we can use it to use the commands)
2. os.listdir
3. os.path.isfile
4. os.remove
## file handling in python
files are names locations on disk to store related information.
in python , a file operation takes place in the following order
- open the file
- read
- close the file.
python has a built function called open()
syntax:
    - with open ("fileName or file path " , "x") as var
        - write ----W
        - read------r
        - append-----a
        - create---------x
        - text mode---------t
        - binary mode-------b
    Write on files
        in order to write on the file we have to open it write append and creation mode.
        syntax:
        - with open("file name","w") s file:
            file.writelline("write any thing")
    Read mood
        syntax: - with open("notes.txt","r") as var:
              a=var.read()
              print(a)
    Checking if the file exit using os module
         syntax: os.path.exists(filename)
### malware #2 - File ransomeware
- we have to install pip install cryptography 
- encrypt the file

- decrypt the files

## malware analysis
To locate what happen or what malware can do.
- The Analysis is Done on the Artifact / sample
    a. Artifact : It is a malware sample Taken from an infected system.
    the person who do it called malware analyst 
    there are two fundamental approaches to malware analysis:
    - static Analysis
    - Dynamic Analysis
    ### static malware analysis
    - This when analysing the malware without Running it.
    - based on the way we do this it is lassified into the following:
        - Basics Static Analysis
        - Advanced Static analysis
    ## Basic static analysis
    - examining the executable file without viewing the actual instruction.
    - Is straight forward and can be quick,but it's largely ineffective against sophisticated malware.
    - Things like
        - antivirus Scanning 
        - Getting if the Attacker of malware
        - checking if the Attacker used packer on it.
        - checking the signature on Different Scanning websites, like : ==virusTotal==,==HybridAnalysis==.
    ## Advanced Static Analysis
    IT is consists of ==reverse-Engineering==.
    # Dynamic Malware Analysis
    - by the running of the malware.
    1. Basics malware anaylsis
    2. Advanced malware analysis
        tools: sysinternal suite , GDB , strace
